## Week 1: Researching existing datasets and methods.

  After looking into the [literature](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8682194) on signal classification using CNNs, I realized I would need a large number of classes to maintain fidelity the velocity of a hit to the drum. This presents a problem because it would be difficult to find a large enough dataset and training would take a lot of time. That is something I didnt realize before and I would like to avoid; hence, I propose a slightly different direction.

  I would like to use the current project to explore means of [positional sensing](https://www.drumforum.org/threads/positional-sensing.144907/) on an electronic drum. The basic idea behind it being the classification of multiple peizo-electric sensor ouputs accross time. When looking for literature on similar projects I found [this](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11314976/) paper where researchers used a few peizo sensors to map out patient's positions while sleeping.

I plan to apply some of the methods in this paper to my project.
