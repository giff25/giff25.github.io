## Week 2: Pivoting to Hotspot detection

### 09/17/2025
After this weekâ€™s agile meeting with professor Bernardo, I am not going to use neural networks for this problem; instead, hotspot detection via a 2d exponential function seems more appropriate. To that end, I familiarized myself with literature on the 2d gaussian distribution. It was difficult to visualize how the different parameters changed the function; hence, [visually seeing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVvuwv-ne1I) the function change through varying parameters helped me make sense of it; additionally, It was fascinating to see where linear algebra came into play on the gaussian function:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^\frac{d}{2} |\Sigma|^\frac{1}{2}}\ 
\exp\left(-\tfrac{1}{2}(\bar{X}-\bar{\mu})^\top \Sigma^{-1} (\bar{X}-\bar{\mu})\right) 
$$


where:
- (k\) is the dimensionality,
- ($\mu$) is the mean vector,
- ($\Sigma$) is the positive-definite covariance matrix,
- ($|\Sigma|$) denotes the determinant of ($\Sigma$).
##### Note: Some of the formatting of this equation was generated by ChatGPT.

This method treats the problem as wave modeling instead of probability distribution; hence, (function[1]) needs to be simplified into an exponential function. This function makes an assumption that the membrane of the drum is uniform; hence, the input signal is treated similarly. 

$$
f(\bar{x}) = a \exp(b ||\bar{x}-\bar{\mu}||^2)
$$

It became clear that my next goal would be to find the function parameters that model the wave correctly. I look forward to discussing this step with professor Bernardo, as I don't know how to do it.
