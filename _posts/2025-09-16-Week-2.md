## Week 2: Pivoting to Hotspot detection

### 09/17/2025
After this week's agile meeting professor bernardo and I decided to lean away from using neural networks for the position sensing; instead, hotspot detection via a 2d gaussian model seems more feasable given the nature of the input. Learning about the 2d gaussian function was interesting. It was fascinating to see where linear algebra came into play on the gaussian function:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^\frac{d}{2} |\Sigma|^\frac{1}{2}}\ 
\exp\left(-\tfrac{1}{2}(X-\mu)^\top \Sigma^{-1} (X-\mu)\right) 
$$
where:
- (k\) is the dimensionality,
- ($\mu$) is the mean vector,
- ($\Sigma$) is the positive-definite covariance matrix,
- ($|\Sigma|$) denotes the determinant of ($\Sigma$).

Once I [visually saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVvuwv-ne1I) how the function behaved by changing parameters it made more sense; furthermore, it became clear that our goal would be to find those parameters in order to fit this function to the data. How to do this I have no clue, and I look forward to speaking to professor Bernardo about it.
