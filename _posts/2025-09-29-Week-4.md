## Week 4: Implementing the function

### The plan:
To start implementing the 2d gaussian function I will need to generate random values for our parameters. This will give a Z value for us to work with. Following this I will need to graph it on a 3d grid -- this will help me see how the gradient descent is working in the later stages. Once I have this working, I will move onto implementing the gradient descent. Ideally, I want to plot a the gaussian function on each forward pass of the gradient descent. Again, this will help me visualize the process, and help me debug any potential problems.

### Implementing:
The first part was went pretty smoothly, I did realize this would be difficult to debug later. To solve this I switched to generating the values once for consistency. rewriting the function in python was simple; however, im now faced with a problem in graphing the values. The matplot toolkit for 3d graphing requires the Z value have 2 dimensions. Im going to dig into the documentation to understand why this is the case. It turns out the code generated by Gemini was trying to plot a continuous 3d plot instead of a scatterplot. I can see why a lot of people discourage new developers from using AI code generation -- lesson learned, "dont use AI for generating code with libraries you arent familiar with". For now, I will stick to a scatter plot, and change when I need to.
