## Week 3: Fitting the 2d Gaussian function

After speaking to professor Bernardo, the I was spot on with my understanding of the next goal. During our meeting the professor worked through simplifying the equation down. 


I started looking into Tensorflow Autodifferentiation. It uses GradientTapes as a means of backpropigation. They exists to remember the operations done during a forward pass in training. To be able to use them I will need to create a Tensorflow module representing my gaussian model. The module will act as a variable state object containing the various peices of my model. In order to "train" the model I will have to add the parameters I am trying to find as watched tf.Variables.

The algorithm
