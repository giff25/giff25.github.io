I'm a senior Computer Science student developing a DSP AI.

It will be responsible for predicting the velocity value from the input signal;furthermore, it will provide it to the existing algorithm that packages and outputs it as a midi note.

In the future I plan to train the AI to process multiple channels, in an attempt to support positional sensing.
