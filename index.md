I'm a senior Computer Science student developing a DSP AI.

It will be responsible for predicting the velocity value from the input signal;furthermore, it will output the value to the existing algorithm that sends the relevent data as a midi package.

In the future I plan to train the AI to process multiple channels, in an attempt to support positional sensing.
